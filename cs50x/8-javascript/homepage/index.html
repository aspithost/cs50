                <h1>Uninteresting Facts about Abel</h1>
                <p>
                    If someone is actually reading some of these pages, you're probably dying to know what the hobbies of the million-something submittee of this assignment are!
                </p>
                <p>
                    My name is Abel Spithost, I'm 31 years old and I live in Groningen, the Netherlands. I started with web development only when I was 27, and I'm not formally schooled in any of this;
                    which is why I'm taking this course! You can find more info about me on any of the other screens of this webpage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though I do have a screen about my hobbies and my beer-league football (or "soccer") career, you really should
                    check out the <a href="/bobbie">page about my dog Bobbie</a> She is a 1-year old labradoodle who is not just cute, but she may even bark at you! Or make some other doggy noise... head on over!
                </p>
